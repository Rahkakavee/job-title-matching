@article{Mathur2008,
   abstract = {Support vector machines (SVMs) have considerable potential for supervised classification analyses, but their binary nature has been a constraint on their use in remote sensing. This typically requires a multiclass analysis be broken down into a series of binary classifications, following either the one-against-one or one-against-all strategies. However, the binary SVM can be extended for a one-shot multiclass classification needing a single optimization operation. Here, an approach for one-shot multi- class classification of multispectral data was evaluated against approaches based on binary SVM for a set of five-class classifications. The one-shot multiclass classification was more accurate (92.00%) than the approaches based on a series of binary classifications (89.22% and 91.33%). Additionally, the one-shot multi- class SVM had other advantages relative to the binary SVM-based approaches, notably the need to be optimized only once for the parameters C and 7 as opposed to five times for one-against-all and ten times for the one-against-one approach, respectively, and used fewer support vectors, 215 as compared to 243 and 246 for the binary based approaches. Similar trends were also apparent in results of analyses of a data set of larger dimensionality. It was also apparent that the conventional one-against-all strategy could not be guaranteed to yield a complete confusion matrix that can greatly limit the assessment and later use of a classification derived by that method. © 2006 IEEE.},
