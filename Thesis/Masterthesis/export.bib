  abstract  = {For the epidemiology of work-related skin diseases, comprising surveillance and analytical approaches, occupational exposure can be represented by the occupation (job title) or the industry a person is working in. For both concepts, several international and national classification systems exist, which are revised from time to time. As global classification of occupations, the “International Standard Classification of Occupations” (ISCO, presently ISCO-08) of the International Labour Organisation is available. The “International Standard Industrial Classification of all Economic Activities” (ISIC), presently in its fourth revision, issued by the United Nations Statistics Division, is globally used to document industrial sectors; however, in several countries national classification systems are (also) used. All such classifications have been developed to serve broad administrative and research purposes. For this reason, it is often necessary to adapt a classification of occupation or industry to medical needs. To this end, a more refined subcategorization, respecting, however, the hierarchical structure of the classification it is based upon, and general rules for the construction of classification systems, can be employed to achieve a best possible degree of detail. Conversely, some other categories (e.g., different types of “office work”) deemed largely identical with regard to relevant exposures may be aggregated. The aim is to achieve a clinically manageable, reliable catalogue and consistent usage aided by clear definitions.},

  abstract  = {"The goal of developing a Classification of Occupations 2010 (KldB 2010) was to create an up-to-date and generally accepted classification of occupations for Germany, which on the one hand satisfies the pronounced occupation-specific structuring of the German labor market and on the other hand enables linking to the International Standard Classification of Occupations 2008 (ISCO 08). In contrast to former occupational classifications in Germany, which were developed deductively based on existing expert knowledge about occupations, the KldB 2010 based on a theory-driven empirical analysis of similarities between occupations and is comple-mented by a coherence check of these aggregation results. In this methodological report, we first give a short introduction to the KldB 2010 as well as their systematic and structural innovations. Afterwards, we show how information on occupations (e.g. information on occupational activity gathered in an interview) can be coded according to the KldB 2010. Thereby, hints for the usage of the classification are provided, particularly in regard to rules of classification and assignment principles. Finally, we provide an overview of currently existing conversion keys from and to KldB 2010." (Author's abstract, IAB-Doku) ((en))},

@article{Mathur2008,
  abstract = {Support vector machines (SVMs) have considerable potential for supervised classification analyses, but their binary nature has been a constraint on their use in remote sensing. This typically requires a multiclass analysis be broken down into a series of binary classifications, following either the one-against-one or one-against-all strategies. However, the binary SVM can be extended for a one-shot multiclass classification needing a single optimization operation. Here, an approach for one-shot multi- class classification of multispectral data was evaluated against approaches based on binary SVM for a set of five-class classifications. The one-shot multiclass classification was more accurate (92.00%) than the approaches based on a series of binary classifications (89.22% and 91.33%). Additionally, the one-shot multi- class SVM had other advantages relative to the binary SVM-based approaches, notably the need to be optimized only once for the parameters C and 7 as opposed to five times for one-against-all and ten times for the one-against-one approach, respectively, and used fewer support vectors, 215 as compared to 243 and 246 for the binary based approaches. Similar trends were also apparent in results of analyses of a data set of larger dimensionality. It was also apparent that the conventional one-against-all strategy could not be guaranteed to yield a complete confusion matrix that can greatly limit the assessment and later use of a classification derived by that method. © 2006 IEEE.},
